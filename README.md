# WebAssessment
What did you like about this project?
It is a good challenge. Can practice more on flex items and layout arrangement.

What did you struggle with in this project?
Not quite familiar with flex, take time to find out how to set the layout, I am a bit confused on my pedding part. Not sure which item should I set the padding or margin.

What would make your experience with this assessment better?
I have better knowledge with the flex and coding for the layout, but still need more practice to improve.
